# EMCS API testing guide

This is a prototype testing guide used for research. The testing process it describes is still in development.

Learn how to test the compatibility of your software with [Excise Movement Control System (EMCS) API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0).

## Before you start

When you are ready to test your software, first read and understand the [EMCS API service guide](/guides/emcs-api-service-guide/) and [EMCS API technical interface specification]() if you have not already done so.

### Testing cycles

You will have to complete at least one testing cycle prior to the go-live of EMCS API.

|Cycle   |Description |Start Date |End Date |Scope   |Message |
|--------|--------    |--------   |-------- |--------|--------|
|        |            |           |         |        |        |

### Test environments

You must use our sandbox environment and EMCS API Test to test the compatibility of your software with EMCS API.
