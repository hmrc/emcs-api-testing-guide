# EMCS API testing guide

Learn how to test the compatibility of your software with [Excise Movement Control System (EMCS) API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0).

## Before you start

When you are ready to test your software, first read and understand the [EMCS API service guide](/guides/emcs-api-service-guide/) and [EMCS API technical interface specification]() if you have not already done so.

You must complete the following steps before testing the API.

1. Ensure that you have an [HMRC developer account](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/login) - if you do not have one, you must [register for an account](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/registration), activate it by email, and sign in.
2. [Create an application](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/applications/add/sandbox) in our test environment called the sandbox.
3. Subscribe to the Excise Movement Control System API on the manage API subscriptions page.
4. Obtain your [Client ID and Client secret credentials](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation/credentials).
5. Follow the steps to [obtain a bearer token](documentation/obtain-a-bearer-token).
6. Use your application to make calls to our stubbed test API in the [testing process](documentation/testing-process).
7. Test the [test scenarios](documentation/test-scenarios).

### Test environment

To allow users to be able to rapidly test the new EMCS API, we have stubbed the back end. If you submit a specific message, you will receive a pre-defined response. There is no validation on the messages, except for simple schema validation.
