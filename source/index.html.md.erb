# EMCS API testing guide

This is a prototype testing guide used for research. The testing process it describes is still in development.

Learn how to test the compatibility of your software with [Excise Movement Control System (EMCS) API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0).

## Before you start

When you are ready to test your software, first read and understand the [EMCS API service guide](/guides/emcs-api-service-guide/) and [EMCS API technical interface specification]() if you have not already done so.

### Test environment

To allow users to be able to rapidly test the new EMCS API, we have stubbed the back end. If you submit a specific message, you will receive a pre-defined response. There is no validation on the messages, except for simple schema validation.

### Testing prerequisites

For information about actions that must be completed before testing, see the getting started section of the [EMCS API service guide](/guides/emcs-api-service-guide/#getting-started)
