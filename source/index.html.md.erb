# EMCS API testing guide
<%= partial 'documentation/partials/google_tag_manager_js' %>
Learn how to test the compatibility of your software with [Excise Movement Control System (EMCS) API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0).

## Before you start

When you are ready to test your software, first read and understand the [EMCS API service guide](/guides/emcs-api-service-guide/) and [EMCS API technical interface specification](/guides/excise-movement-control-system-api-tis/) if you have not already done so.

You must complete the following steps before testing the API.

1. Ensure that you have an [HMRC developer account](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/login) - if you do not have one, you must [register for an account](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/registration), activate it by email, and sign in.
2. [Create an application](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/applications/add/sandbox) in our test environment called the sandbox.
3. Subscribe to the Excise Movement Control System API on the manage API subscriptions page.
4. Obtain your [Client ID and Client secret credentials](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation/credentials).
5. Use the [Create Test User API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-platform-test-user/1.0) to create one or more test users for your sandbox application. 

## Testing your software.

1. Test the [authorisation process](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation/user-restricted-endpoints).
2. Use your application to make calls to our stubbed test API in the [testing process](documentation/testing-process).
3. Test the [test scenarios](documentation/test-scenarios).

### Test environment

To allow users to be able to rapidly test the new EMCS API, we have stubbed the back end. To act as a realistic representation of the production API, the stub provides the same validation for level 1 and level 2 validation as the production API will. It does not provide level 3 validation.

You can simulate common error responses by sending messages with standard inputs. These are detailed in the [test scenarios](documentation/test-scenarios.html).

## Push pull notification testing
When testing your software, you can be sent automatic notifications using the Push Pull Notifications API.

This is where notifications from EMCS are sent to your software in near real time.

To get these automatic messages, you must:

- subscribe to the Push Pull Notifications Service
- subscribe to the Excise Movement Control System (EMCS) API
- configure the notification URL in the subscription configuration section of Developer Hub

**Note:** if your notification web address is hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) then you must either use [edge-optimised custom domain names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-edge-optimized-custom-domain-name.html)
or [regional custom domain names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-regional-api-custom-domain-create.html).

### How it works
This diagram shows an example of the process where your service needs to return a 200 HTTP status as part of the automated notification process.
