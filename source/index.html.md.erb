# EMCS API testing guide

Learn how to test the compatibility of your software with [Excise Movement Control System (EMCS) API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0).

## Before you start

When you are ready to test your software, first read and understand the [EMCS API service guide](/guides/emcs-api-service-guide/) and [EMCS API technical interface specification]() if you have not already done so.

You must complete the following steps before testing the API.

1. Ensure that you have an [HMRC developer account](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/login) - if you do not have one, you must [register for an account](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/registration), activate it by email, and sign in.
2. [Create an application](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/applications/add/sandbox) in our test environment called the sandbox.
3. Subscribe to the Excise Movement Control System API on the manage API subscriptions page.
4. Obtain your [Client ID and Client secret credentials](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation/credentials).
5. Use the [Create Test User API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-platform-test-user/1.0) to create one or more test users for your sandbox application. 

You must [create a separate Test User for EMCS API](documentation/create-a-test-user.html). You may not be able to use Test Users from other API services.

## Testing your software.

1. Test the [authorisation process](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation/user-restricted-endpoints).
2. Use your application to make calls to our stubbed test API in the [testing process](documentation/testing-process).
3. Test the [test scenarios](documentation/test-scenarios).

### Test environment

To allow users to be able to rapidly test the new EMCS API, we have stubbed the back end. To act as a realistic representation of the production API, the stub provides the same validation for level 1 and level 2 validation as the production API will. It does not provide level 3 validation.

You can simulate common error responses by sending messages with standard inputs. These are detailed in the [test scenarios](documentation/test-scenarios.html).
