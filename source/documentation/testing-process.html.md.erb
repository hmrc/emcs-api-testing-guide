# Testing process
<%= partial 'documentation/partials/google_tag_manager_js' %>
You must test the compatibility of your software with [EMCS API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0).

After [creating a Test User](create-a-test-user.html), use Postman or curl to call the API at: <br></br> `https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/customs/excise/movements`

1. The Consignor ID should match the one used in the [Test User process](create-a-test-user.html) to be authorised to send an IE815 message.
2. Follow details on the developer hub to get the user-restricted access token - 
    1. Sign into government gateway with the Test User
    2. Give permission to EMCS
    3. Generate a token, and copy it.
3. Use that token as bearer token in the IE815 message, replacing `[YOUR-USER-RESTRICTED-ACCESS-TOKEN]` in the example below.
4. Replace `<urn:IE815>...</urn:IE815>` with the relevant IE number and [XML for the message you are testing](https://github.com/hmrc/excise-movement-control-system-api/tree/main/app/xsd).

For example:

```
POST /customs/excise/movements HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/xml
Accept: application/vnd.hmrc.1.0+json
Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-USER-RESTRICTED-ACCESS-TOKEN]
Host: test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk
<urn:IE815>
 ...
</urn:IE815>
```

Make sure to test your software with all the messages and endpoints in the [test scenarios](test-scenarios.html).
