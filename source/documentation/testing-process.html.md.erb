# Testing process

You must test the compatibility of your software with [EMCS API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0).

After [obtaining a bearer token](obtain-a-bearer-token.html), use postman or curl to call the API at: <br></br> `https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/customs/excise/movements`

The following values in angled brackets (<>) must be replaced:

- `<your-access-token>` - your [bearer token](obtain-a-bearer-token.html). Make sure to replace the angled brackets (<>) as well.
- `<urn:IE815>...</urn:IE815>` - keep the angled brackets (<>), and replace with the relevant IE number and [XML for the message you are testing](https://github.com/hmrc/excise-movement-control-system-api/tree/main/app/xsd).

For example:

```
POST /customs/excise/movements HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/xml
Accept: application/vnd.hmrc.1.0+json
Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>
Host: test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 5309
<urn:IE815>
 ...
</urn:IE815>
```

Make sure to test your software with all the messages and endpoints in the [test scenarios](test-scenarios.html).
