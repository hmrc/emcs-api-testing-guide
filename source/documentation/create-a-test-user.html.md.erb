# Create a Test User
<%= partial 'documentation/partials/google_tag_manager_js' %>
You must create a separate Test User for EMCS API. You should not use a Test User that you have created for other API services.

## Excise Number

The Create Test User API does not currently include an Excise Number field. This is in development, and will be included in a future release.

In the meantime, you should use the `eoriNumber` field in the body of the request to enter an Excise Number. This replaces the Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number.

If you have previously created a Test User with an EORI number you will not be able to use them to test EMCS API, and must follow the process below.

## Process

You should follow these steps to generate a Test User:

1. Review the [Create Test User API documentation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-platform-test-user/1.0/) on the Developer Hub.
2. Make sure that your application is subscribed to the Create Test User API. You can find this under 'Manage API subscriptions' on the Developer Hub, in the 'APIs for testing your service' section.
3. Use Postman or curl to call the [Create a test user which is an organisation](https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/create-test-user/organisation) endpoint. 
4. Use Client ID and Client secret as client credentials to generate an application-restricted access token.<br></br>For example:

    ```
    POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Host: test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk
    grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=[YOUR-CLIENT-ID]&client_secret=[YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET]
    ```
5. Copy that token
6. In the body of the request
    1. Use serviceNames: “excise-movement-control-system”
    2. For eoriNumber: use the Test User’s Excise ID - e.g. consignor ID, consignee ID or warehousekeeper ID

    For example:

    ```
    POST /create-test-user/organisations HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/vnd.hmrc.1.0+json
    Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-APPLICATION-RESTRICTED-ACCESS-TOKEN]
    Content-Type: application/json
    Host: test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk
    {
      "serviceNames": [
        "excise-movement-control-system"
      ],
      "eoriNumber": "[YOUR-EXCISE-NUMBER]"
        }
    ```
7. A successful response will return a Test User’s details. Take a note of the user ID and the password for the next step in the [testing process](testing-process.html).
