# Test scenarios

You should test the following scenarios to make sure your software is compatible with EMCS API.

## Endpoint: Submit a new draft excise movement.

To test [this endpoint](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/submitMovement) in the External Test environment, you will need to provide a request with an XML body that conforms to the [IE815 XML Schema](https://github.com/hmrc/excise-movement-control-system-api/blob/main/app/xsd/ie815-v16-0.xsd).

Within the IE815 XML body you can send the following local reference numbers (LRNs) to simulate responses:


| Local reference number (LRN) | 	Response                 |
|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------|
| SendA400                     | 400 Bad Request           |
| SendA404                     | 404 Not Found             |
| SendA500                     | 500 Internal Server Error |
| SendA503                     | 503 Service Unavailable   |
| Any other valid value        | 200 Success               |

A success response will take the form of 

```
{
  "consignorId": "GBWK002281023",
  "consigneeId": "GBWKQOZ8OVLYR",
  "localReferenceNumber": "LRNQA20230909022221",
  "status": "Accepted"
}
```

A 400 Bad Request error response will take the form of

```
{
  "dateTime": "2021-12-17T09:30:47Z",
  "message": "Json validation failed",
  "debugMessage": "user is missing but it is required",
  "emcsCorrelationId": "3e8dae97-b586-4cef-8511-68ac12da9028"
}
```

A 404 Not Found error response will take the form of

```
{
  "dateTime": "2021-12-17T09:30:47Z",
  "message": "Received error response from server",
  "debugMessage": "Connection refused; nested exception is java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused",
  "emcsCorrelationId": "3e8dae97-b586-4cef-8511-68ac12da9028"
}
```

A 500 Internal Server Error response will take the form of

```
{
  "dateTime": "2021-12-17T09:30:47Z",
  "message": "Invalid JSON structure",
  "debugMessage": "JSON parse error: Unexpected character",
  "emcsCorrelationId": "3e8dae97-b586-4cef-8511-68ac12da9028"
}
```

A 503 Service Unavailable error response will take the form of

```
{
  "dateTime": "2021-12-17T09:30:47Z",
  "message": "CIRCUIT_BREAKER - 815_CB is OPEN",
  "debugMessage": "CircuitBreaker '815_CB' is OPEN and does not permit further calls",
  "emcsCorrelationId": "3e8dae97-b586-4cef-8511-68ac12da9028"
}
```

## Endpoint: Submit a message for an excise movement

You must make sure you have first tested the [Submit a draft excise movement (IE815) endpoint](#endpoint-submit-a-new-draft-excise-movement), and received a success response.

You can test [this endpoint](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/postMessage) in the External Test environment with several different messages.

### IE818 - Report of receipt

You will need to provide a request with an XML body that conforms to the [IE818 XML Schema](https://github.com/hmrc/excise-movement-control-system-api/blob/main/app/xsd/ie818-v16-0.xsd).

Within the IE818 XML body you can send the following values as Complementary Information to simulate responses:


| Complementary Information    | 	Response                 |
|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------|
| SendA400                     | 400 Bad Request           |
| SendA404                     | 404 Not Found             |
| SendA500                     | 500 Internal Server Error |
| SendA503                     | 503 Service Unavailable   |
| Any other valid value        | 202 Accepted             |

A success response will have headers and a status, but will contain no body content.

A 400 Bad Request error response will take the form of

```
{
  "dateTime": "2021-12-17T09:30:47Z",
  "message": "Json validation failed",
  "debugMessage": "user is missing but it is required",
  "emcsCorrelationId": "3e8dae97-b586-4cef-8511-68ac12da9028"
}
```

A 404 Not Found error response will take the form of

```
{
  "dateTime": "2021-12-17T09:30:47Z",
  "message": "Received error response from server",
  "debugMessage": "Connection refused; nested exception is java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused",
  "emcsCorrelationId": "3e8dae97-b586-4cef-8511-68ac12da9028"
}
```

A 500 Internal Server Error response will take the form of

```
{
  "dateTime": "2021-12-17T09:30:47Z",
  "message": "Invalid JSON structure",
  "debugMessage": "JSON parse error: Unexpected character",
  "emcsCorrelationId": "3e8dae97-b586-4cef-8511-68ac12da9028"

```
{
  "dateTime": "2021-12-17T09:30:47Z",
  "message": "CIRCUIT_BREAKER - 815_CB is OPEN",
  "debugMessage": "CircuitBreaker '815_CB' is OPEN and does not permit further calls",
  "emcsCorrelationId": "3e8dae97-b586-4cef-8511-68ac12da9028"
}
```

## Endpoint: Get all messages for an excise movement using the localReferenceNumber

You must make sure you have first tested the [Submit a draft excise movement (IE815) endpoint](#endpoint-submit-a-new-draft-excise-movement), and received a success response.

You can test [this endpoint](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/getAllMessages) in the External Test environment by calling `https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/customs/excise/movements/{localReferenceNumber}/messages`.

If you replace `{localReferenceNumber}` in the URL with one of these LRNs, you will return a success response:

```
LRNIE8158976912
LRNIE8156540856
LRNIE8155973812
LRNIE8151695045
LRNIE8155743934
LRNIE8154968571
LRNIE8151232757
LRNIE8153786132
LRNIE8158366950
LRNIE8157359518
```

Any other valid LRN will return no messages.

A success response will take the form of 

```
{
"dateTime": "2023-09-07T12:39:20.354Z",
"exciseRegistrationNumber": "XIWK000467015",
