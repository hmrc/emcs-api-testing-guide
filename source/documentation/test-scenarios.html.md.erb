# Test scenarios

This is a prototype testing guide used for research. The testing process it describes is still in development.

## Endpoint: Submit a new draft excise movement.

To test [this endpoint](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/submitMovement) in the External Test environment, you will need to provide a request with an XML body that conforms to the [IE815 XML Schema](https://github.com/hmrc/excise-movement-control-system-api/blob/main/app/xsd/ie815-v16-0.xsd).

Within the IE815 XML body you can send the following local reference numbers (LRNs) to simulate responses:


| Local reference number (LRN) | 	Response                 |
|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------|
| SendA400                     | 400 Bad Request           |
| SendA404                     | 404 Not Found             |
| SendA500                     | 500 Internal Server Error |
| SendA503                     | 503 Service Unavailable   |
| Any other valid value        | 200 Success               |

A success response will take the form of 

```
