# Test scenarios
<%= partial 'documentation/partials/google_tag_manager_js' %>
You should test the following scenarios to make sure your software is compatible with EMCS API.

## Endpoint: Submit a new draft excise movement

You should test [this endpoint](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/submitMovement) first.

To test this endpoint in the External Test environment, you will need to provide a request with an XML body that conforms to the [IE815 XML Schema](https://github.com/hmrc/excise-movement-control-system-api/blob/main/app/xsd/ie815.xsd). An [IE815 example XML](https://github.com/hmrc/excise-movement-control-system-api/blob/main/resources/public/api/conf/1.0/examples/IE815.xml) can be found on GitHub.

### Get messages

If you also want to test the endpoint ['Get all messages for an excise movement using the movementId'](#endpoint-get-all-messages-for-an-excise-movement-using-the-movementid), you must use one of the LRNs in that section.

### Error cases

You can activate specific responses by passing in specific values in 2 ways:

1. As a local reference number (LRN). This is a legacy testing method and will be deprecated.
2. As a MessageIdentifier value in the XML header. This is the preferred method and will take the form below:

```
<urn:Message>
  <urn:Header>
    <urn1:MessageSender>token</urn1:MessageSender>
    <urn1:MessageRecipient>token</urn1:MessageRecipient>
    <urn1:DateOfPreparation>2008-09-29</urn1:DateOfPreparation>
    <urn1:TimeOfPreparation>00:18:33</urn1:TimeOfPreparation>
    <urn1:MessageIdentifier>[MESSAGE IDENTIFIER VALUE]</urn1:MessageIdentifier>
    <!--Optional:-->
    <urn1:CorrelationIdentifier>token</urn1:CorrelationIdentifier>
  </urn:Header>
</urn:Message>
```

You can send the following values to simulate responses:


| Message Identifier / LRN value     | 	Response                 |
|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------|
| SendA400                     | 400 Bad Request           |

| SendA500                     | 500 Internal Server Error |
| SendA503                     | 503 Service Unavailable   |
| Any other valid value        | 202 Accepted              |

A success response will take the form of 

```

```


## Endpoint: Get excise movements

You must make sure you have first tested the [Submit a draft excise movement (IE815) endpoint](#endpoint-submit-a-new-draft-excise-movement), and received a success response.

You can test [this endpoint](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/getAllMovements) in the External Test environment by calling `https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/customs/excise/movements?lrn=[YOUR_LRN]&ern=[YOUR_ERN]&arc=[YOUR_ARC]&updatedSince=[DATE_TIME]`.

All four query parameters are optional.

If you are polling this endpoint for updated movements, you may want to consider using the latest `lastUpdated` from the response as the `updatedSince` query parameter, next time you poll as an optimisation.

A success response will take the form of 

```
[
  {
    "movementId" : "cfdb20c7-d0b0-4b8b-a071-737d68dede5e",

    "lastUpdated": "2024-01-17T15:25:29.540Z"
  }
]
```

A 400 Bad Request will be returned if the query parameters are invalid, and will take the form of

```
{
  "dateTime": "2024-03-06T12:09:47.420688Z",
  "message": "Invalid date format provided in the updatedSince query parameter",
  "debugMessage": "Date format should be like '2020-11-15T17:02:34.00Z'"

## Endpoint: Get all messages for an excise movement using the movementId


You can test [this endpoint](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/getAllMessages) in the External Test environment by calling `https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/customs/excise/movements/{movementId}/messages?updatedSince=[DATE_TIME]`, where updatedSince is an optional query parameter.

The movementId is returned in response to a draft submission, and is a random unique UUID.

If you replace `{movementId}` in the URL with the movementID associated with a submission that was made with one of the following LRNs in the XML body, you can test the scenarios and message responses from this [table](#get-messages-test-scenarios).


You should make sure the example LRNs are copied exactly, and are lowercase when you make the XML body for the draft submission. Using a movementId that is not associated with a valid LRN will return no messages.

A success response will take the form of 

```
[
  {
    "encodedMessage": "PElFODE1PjwhLS0gRXhhbXBsZSBJRTgxNSBtZXNzYWdlIC0tPjwvSUU4MTU+",
    "messageType": "IE801",
    "messageId": "XI00005",
    "createdOn": "2023-10-30T15:36:08.985Z"
    "recipient": "GBWK002281023"
  },
  {
    "encodedMessage": "PElFODAxPjwhLS0gRXhhbXBsZSBJRTgwMSBtZXNzYWdlIC0tPjwvSUU4MDE+",
    "messageType": "IE818",
    "messageId": "XI00008",
    "createdOn": "2023-10-30T15:36:08.985Z"
    "recipient": "GBWKQOZ8OVLYR"
  }
]
```

## Endpoint: Get a message for an excise movement using the movementId and the messageId

You can test [this endpoint](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/getMessage) in the External Test environment by calling `https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/customs/excise/movements/{movementId}/messages/{messageId}`.

The movementId is returned in response to a draft submission, and is a random unique UUID.

If you replace `{movementId}` and the `{messageId}`in the URL with the respective movementID associated with a submission that was made with one of the following LRNs in the XML body, and with the messageId belonging to one of the message for an excise movement then you will able to test the scenarios and message responses in this [table](#get-messages-test-scenarios).


You should make sure the example LRNs are copied exactly, and are lowercase when you make the XML body for the draft submission. Using a movementId that is not associated with a valid LRN will return a not found error.

A success response will return the message as XML.


## Endpoint: Get information relating to an excise trader


You can test [this endpoint](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Traders/operation/prevalidateTrader) in the External Test environment by calling `https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/customs/excise/traders/pre-validate`.

There is a limit of 10 product codes per request.

A request takes the form of

```
{
  "exciseTraderValidationRequest": {
    "exciseTraderRequest": {
      "exciseRegistrationNumber": "GBWK000000206",
