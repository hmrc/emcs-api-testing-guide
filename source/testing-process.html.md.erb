# Testing process

This is a prototype testing guide used for research. The testing process it describes is still in development.

You must test the compatibility of your software with [EMCS API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0).

## Development setup

Run from the console using: ```$ sbt run``` (starts on port 10253 by default)

### Highlighted SBT Tasks

| Task | Description | Command |
| ---  | ----------- | ------  |
| run | Runs the application with the default configured port | ```$ sbt run``` |
| test | Runs the standard unit tests | ```$ sbt test``` |
| it:test | Runs the integration tests | ```$ sbt it:test``` |
