# Testing process

This is a prototype testing guide used for research. The testing process it describes is still in development.

You must test the compatibility of your software with [EMCS API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0).

## Testing your software.

Further information about testing your software will appear here.
